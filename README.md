Sans Nouveau is a sans serif font family. In building the italic forms of the family, the glyph for "f" should be replaced with "Æ’"; all else should be treated as expected.

Sans Nouveau is a sans serif font, meaning it lacks a serif. It is based on an older font of mine called "Retro Nouveau". Like Retro Nouveau, Sans Nouveau contains over 900 glyphs, most of which are Latin characters. Unlike Retro Nouveau, Sans Nouveau is round and looks like something you might see outside of a videogame, for example in a Google Docs document.
